# D3 Workshop
MFA Design and Technology, Parsons The New School for Design

---

3-hour workshop for the students of the Parsons MFA DT program. This workshop is sort of a condensed version of [Scott Murray](http://alignedleft.com/)'s amazing book [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345). Other sources are cited along within the code.

Data was downloaded from [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/):

* [Life expectancy (years)](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA&output=xls
)
* [Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted)](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg&output=xls)
* [Geographic Regions](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phT4mwjvEuGBtdf1ZeO7_PQ&gid=1
